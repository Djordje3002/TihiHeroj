# TihiHeroj

**TihiHeroj** is a SwiftUI-based mobile application designed to allow users in Serbia to **anonymously report violence**. The app enables users to submit detailed incident reports, share their location, and upload supporting evidence—all with a focus on privacy and safety.

This project was developed as part of a SwiftyLabs course, in collaboration with the **City of Vranje** and **KZM Vranje**.(Office for Young People)
